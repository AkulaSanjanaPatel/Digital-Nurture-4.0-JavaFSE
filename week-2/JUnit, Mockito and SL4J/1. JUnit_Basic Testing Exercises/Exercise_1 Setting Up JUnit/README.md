## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code) with Java support.

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Ensure that the JUnit library (`junit-4.13.2.jar`) is included in your classpath for testing.

### Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the `src/main/java` directory and execute the `App.java` file. This file contains the `main` method which serves as the entry point for the application.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, ensure that the JUnit library is included in your classpath. You can execute the tests in `AppTest.java` using your IDE's built-in test runner or from the command line.
