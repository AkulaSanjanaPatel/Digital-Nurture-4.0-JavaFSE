Dear Sir/Mam,

	Because of so many files in creating the react app the git is not supporting to upload all the files and folders related to the react so I am attaching two screenshots, one of them tells you about the "App.js" and next one is the output of the react project.

I can't include node_modules because of that folder contains lots of files which have downloaded for react.
