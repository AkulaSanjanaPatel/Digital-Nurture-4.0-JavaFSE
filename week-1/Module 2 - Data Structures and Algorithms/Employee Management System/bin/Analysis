Step-4:- Analysis

-> Time Complexity
Operation	Time Complexity
Add	O(1) (at end)
Search	O(n)
Traverse	O(n)
Delete	O(n) (shift required)

-> Limitations of Arrays:
Fixed size — resizing requires copying to a new array.

Costly deletions/insertions — requires shifting elements.

Wasted space if array isn’t fully used.

-> When to Use Arrays:
When size is known in advance and doesn’t change often.

When you need fast access by index.

When memory layout matters (e.g., cache performance).
