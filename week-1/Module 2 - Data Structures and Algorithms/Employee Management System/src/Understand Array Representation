-> Array in Memory:
Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory where each element can be accessed using an index.

The address of any element can be found using:

"Address = Base + (Index Ã— Size_of_element)"


-> Advantages:
Fast access (O(1)) using index.

Simple to implement and use.

Memory efficient for fixed-size datasets.
