Step-4:- Analysis
-> Time Complexity Comparison
Algorithm	Best Case	Average/Worst Case
Linear Search	O(1)	O(n)
Binary Search	O(1)	O(log n)

-> When to Use Each Algorithm
Linear Search:

Best for unsorted or small datasets.

Simple to implement.

Binary Search:

Best for large, sorted datasets.

More efficient but requires sorting beforehand.
