Step-1:- Understand Search Algorithms
-> Linear Search:
Scans each element one by one.

Does not require sorted data.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(1)

Worst Case: O(n)

->Book Binary Search:
Divides the array in half each step.

Requires sorted data.

Time Complexity:

Best/Average/Worst: O(log n)
