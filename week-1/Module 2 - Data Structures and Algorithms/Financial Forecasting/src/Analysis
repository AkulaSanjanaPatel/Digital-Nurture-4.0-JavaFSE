Step-4:- Analysis
-> Time Complexity
Version	Time    Complexity
Recursive	    O(n)
Memoized	    O(n)

Even though both are O(n), memoization avoids redundant recursive calls, especially useful if the function is called repeatedly with overlapping subproblems (like in Fibonacci).

-> Optimization Techniques
Memoization: Store previously computed values to avoid recomputation.

Iterative Approach: Convert to loop-based method for better control of stack and memory.

Tail Recursion (if language/compiler supports optimization).
