Step-1:- Understand Recursive Algorithms
-> What is Recursion?
A recursive algorithm calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the problem.

Each recursive call reduces the problem size until a base case is met.

-> Why Use Recursion?
It simplifies problems that have repetitive substructure like:

Computing compound interest

Tree traversal

Fibonacci series

Often more elegant and readable, though can be less efficient without optimization.
