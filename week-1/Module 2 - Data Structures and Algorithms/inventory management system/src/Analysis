Step - 4:- Analysis

Time Complexity (HashMap-based):

Add: O(1) — Inserting into a HashMap.

Update: O(1) — Accessing and modifying via key.

Delete: O(1) — Removal by key.

Search/Get: O(1) — Direct lookup by productId.

Optimizations:

If memory is a concern and data is large, consider:

Using a database for persistent and scalable storage.

Indexing for fast queries.

ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations in multi-threaded environments.

For frequent sorted queries, consider TreeMap (O(log n) operations, but maintains order).
