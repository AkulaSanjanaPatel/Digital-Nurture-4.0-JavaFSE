Step-1:- Understand Linked Lists
-> Types of Linked Lists:
Type	Description
Singly Linked List	Each node points to the next node. Traversal is forward-only.
Doubly Linked List	Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes. Allows bidirectional traversal.

-> Linked List vs Array
Feature	                Array	                Linked List
Size	                Fixed (or resized)	    Dynamic
Insertion/Deletion	    Costly (O(n))	        Efficient (O(1) at head)
Access by Index	        O(1)	                O(n)
