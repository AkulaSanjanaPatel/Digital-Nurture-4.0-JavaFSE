Step-4:- Analysis

-> Time Complexity
Algorithm	Time Complexity
Linear Search	O(n)
Binary Search	O(log n)

Linear search is simple but slow for large datasets.

Binary search is faster but requires the data to be sorted first.

-> Which Is More Suitable?
For small or unsorted datasets, linear search is fine.

For large, sorted product lists, binary search is preferred.

In real-world platforms, search is often powered by indexes, hash maps, or search engines like Elasticsearch for high-speed performance.
