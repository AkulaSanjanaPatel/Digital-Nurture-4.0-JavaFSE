Step-4: Analysis

-> Time Complexity Comparison
Algorithm	    Best	        Average	        Worst
Bubble Sort	    O(n)	        O(n²)	        O(n²)
Quick Sort	    O(n log n)	    O(n log n)	    O(n²) (rare)

-> Why Quick Sort is Preferred:
Faster in practice due to fewer swaps and better use of memory cache.

Bubble sort is easy to implement but very slow on large datasets.

Quick sort is efficient and widely used in production environments.
