Step-1 Understanding Sorting Algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
-> Description: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

-> Time Complexity:

Best: O(n)

Average/Worst: O(n²)

2. Insertion Sort
-> Description: Builds the final sorted list one item at a time.

-> Time Complexity:

Best: O(n)

Average/Worst: O(n²)

3. Quick Sort
-> Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm. Picks a pivot, partitions array, then recursively sorts.

-> Time Complexity:

Best/Average: O(n log n)

Worst: O(n²) (rare with good pivot)

4. Merge Sort
-> Description: Recursively divides the list into halves and merges them in sorted order.

-> Time Complexity: Always O(n log n)
